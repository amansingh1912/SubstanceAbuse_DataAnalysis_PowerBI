## Understanding of Data:
Primarily, according to requirement of the report there were 2 main factors on which analysis was required to be done which were Demographic analysis on mental
health aspects & hospitalization programs.
Additionally, I added one extra factor which is Substance Abuse Analysis.
I analyzed these 3 parameters on the following factors like Gender, Sex, age, Month and Program

## Application of DAX Measures:
During the making of dashboard, I applied the following DAX measures for the following criteria:
Types of Programs, MHD Types, SUD Types, Average of Daily Living Activity Test

## Visualization in Power BI:
I splitted the pages namely in 2 pages which are:
#### Overview  
#### Detailed Analysis
* Overview page contains key headlines and recommendations about the dataset according to Detailed Analysis of the dataset.
* Detailed Analysis page contains detailed program analysis, mental health analysis and substance abuse analysis on the basis of factors discussed above.

### Theme and Color Palette:
* Background color used for the dashboard is green.
* Colors used: Green, white, orange and blue.

### Visualization:
Here, I used Figma for creating layout for background which is 16:9 with 720*1280px

## Conclusion:
Overall, it was good dataset to visualize and it improved my understanding of using graphs, coming up with relevant questions and coming up with insights.
